<h2>Why choose us?</h2>

<p class="intro">Nike is good at a lot of things: manufacturing quality shoes; supplying equipment and gear for many professional and collegiate athletic teams; and making a ton of money. But where the company truly excels is its marketing. Nobody does branding quite like Nike. I would be shocked if there is a single person reading this article who hasn’t heard of Nike; in fact, most of you probably own at least one Nike product (As I write this, I’m actually wearing an article of clothing with a Nike logo on it).

So how did Nike reach the pinnacle of the sports world and become a corporate juggernaut? It wasn’t because of their shoes (which are good but often unremarkable). Nike dominates the sports gear industry because of their brilliant branding strategies. Here are four of the reasons why Nike is the reigning king of branding:</p>

<p class="intro">1. Nike has the most dynamic logo on the planet. Although it was famously designed by then student Carolyn Davidson for a few bucks, the Swoosh is one of the best logos of all time. It’s simple, looks great on a shoe or anything else and suggests activity, arousal and victory at the same time – perfect for a sports brand.</p>
<p class="intro">2. Nike started with running. There’s no point in denying that the sneaker game has slowly shifted its focus to running, even in the US. And regardless of all that Jordan hype, Nike started out as a running company – and not just track-and-field running. Co-founder Bill Bowerman recognized the potential of “jogging” in the early ‘60s, and published a book with that title in 1966. His ideas led to the creation of a running shoe that would ultimately be named the “Cortez” in 1968.</p>
<p class="intro">3. Nike has Jordan. Despite its roots in running, Nike has been synonymous with basketball – and basketball is Jordan, to some extent. Together they formed the cornerstones for the rise of a global sneaker culture. Although adidas has had successful basketball shoes a decade before, it was his Airness who popularized sneakers as a fashion and style item. The Air Jordan 1 was also designed by Peter Moore, almost a decade before the same Peter Moore would design the “three bars logo” which is now synonymous with adidas Equipment.</p>
<p class="intro">4. Nike has Back to the Future. Nike’s use of this movie wasn’t just smart product placement but arguably the most brilliant and long-term marketing move of the millennium, spanning three decades in the rollout. First: presenting the Nike Bruin in part 1 in 1985 – in one of the most iconic pop-cultural movies ever. Second: Fictionally imagining how sneakers would evolve 30 years later in part 2 and introducing the Nike Mag. Third: actually releasing that shoe as predicted in the movie – finally with power-lacing and endorsement by Michael J. Fox – no other company even comes close.</p>
<p class="intro">5. Nike owns basketball. Not because of names like Michael Jordan, Lebron James or Kevin Durant but because the Swoosh owns the category – today. With a market share of 95% in the U.S. there’s no way around the fact, although adidas is making a lot of right moves at the moment.</p>
